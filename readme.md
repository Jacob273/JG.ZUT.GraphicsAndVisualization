A project related to computer graphics and visualization for educational purposes, a part of this project is:

* Learn how to create scenes in Unity

* Implement C# "scripts" to transform Unity objects with low level matrices (transformation matrices: rotation, scale, translation)

* Getting to know Unity API & components possibilities
  
  ### 1. My very first unity scene
