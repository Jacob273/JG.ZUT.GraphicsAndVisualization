A project related to computer graphics and visualization for educational purposes, a part of this project is:

* To learn how to create scenes in Unity

* To implement C# "scripts" to transform Unity objects with low level matrices (transformation matrices: rotation, scale, translation)

* To learn the basics of Unity API & their components
  
  ### 1. My very first unity scene

Game demo was extended with following:
- Main application view
- Head Up Display (HUD, it does play last picked item)
- Door component which may be opened when there's an suitable apple :) to open it
- Throwable weapon (cube) with fire animation which does reduce health of enemies/players when it hits the collider of Player/Enemy
- Text about current situation in game, which is displayed on the bottom of the screen (about quests/picked items/other informations)
- Text with player name and health points
- Quest which is finished when two specific enemies are killed
